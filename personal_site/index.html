        <p>Hi, I'm Nyiema!  I'm a skilled writer who's looking for ways to combine my love of writing with coding.</p>

        <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
          <p>Hi!  My name is Nyiema.  I'm a Bay Area native.  I was born in Berkeley, California at 24 minutes after midnight on a Wednesday night in April of 1981.  I grew up in Castro Valley, a quiet suburb in the East Bay while attending private school in Berkeley and Oakland.  I lived in Los Angeles for a few years while attending U.S.C. where I majored in English.  After college, I moved back to Bay and it's been my primary base of operations ever since.  However, I have spent a year living in each of the following cities(while helping different friends with businesses they were starting): Tucson, Arizona; Mill Spring, North Carolina; and Madison, Wisconsin.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>My Family</h3>
          <p>I have one little sister.  Her name is Simone and she works as a make-up artist down in Los Angeles.  My dad was an Architect and Engineer, who built the first completely solar-powered house in California.  My mom is a child psychologist, and just retired after working at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland for more than 30 years.  My step-dad passed away last year after a 15-year battle with Alzheimer's.</p>
          <br>
        <h3>My Interests</h3>
          <p>In my free time, I like to paint, write poetry, go salsa dancing, ride my Suzuki AN Burgman 400 scooter, and go to the Dog Park with my two dogs(Lolly T. Bop Doodle and Blackfoot).  I'm a published poet who used to have the time to read 3-5 books a week before I decided to pursue learning coding.</p>
